# Island-Lake-Survey-Visualiser
I visualised one of my assignments using Java Swing.

Run java Main.java.

## How islands and lakes are defined
Piece's of land are represented as 1. For an two pieces of land to be part of the same island, they must touch at an adjacent side (left, right, top, bottom).

Lakes are bodies of water encompassed on all 4 sides and 4 corners by land.

Makes use of a Partition ADT
